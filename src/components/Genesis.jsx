                Nestled at the base of Lebanon's Western Bekaa, lies the picturesque villages of Rachaya, a serene landscape where nature's bounty thrives. It is here, amidst the rolling hills and fertile soil that the journey of MounehWZeytouneh began. Our passion for preserving the timeless traditions of Lebanese cuisine is infused into every jar of Labneh, every jar of olives, every spoonful of jams, and every drop of fragrant flower water we meticulously craft.
